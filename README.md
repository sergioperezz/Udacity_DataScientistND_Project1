# Analysis of Airbnb in Madrid

This repository is the second part of the project 1 of the Data Science Nanodegree of Udacity.

## Project Motivation

The goals of this project are:

To follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1) Pick a dataset.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

Prepare data:

Gather necessary data to answer your questions
Handle categorical and missing data
Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.
4) Communicate your business insights:

Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
Your deliverables will be a Github repo and a blog post. Use the rubric here to assist in successfully completing this project!

## File Descriptions

The project includes the jupyternotebook where all the process has been developed. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
