## Results

The main results are:

1) How to get good reviews?

- Cleanliness, communication and the check in process seems the main factors that affect to have good reviews.

2) How is the distribution of the Airbnb in Madrid per host and per room type?

- 62.2% of the Airbnb apartments in Madrid are entire apartments, homes, or hotel rooms. In the other hand, almost 20% of the poeple have 2 or more Airbnb to rent, and 5 of them have more than 100 Apartments.

3) Is there a trend in the reviews number?
- The main point we can extract is that the growth in the Airbnb use is huge. Also, in terms of seasonality August and September seems to have the lowest number of ratings, which is probably translated in lower turist.
